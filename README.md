Building Material Cost Estimator


INTRODUCTION :

This project helps IAAC students learn Python and OpenCV through hands-on exercises. It is designed for MRAC students entering their second term, where they focus on sensing.
This tool is a beginner-friendly way to learn Python by working on a simple, real-world problem: estimating flooring costs based on room size and material choice.


DESCRIPTION:

This project is designed for students with an architectural background who are new to Python.üêç 
Therefore it assumes that every student is an absolute beginner and is used to teach the fundamental concepts of Python through a hands on approach.
In addition the project teaches Python fundamentals through an interactive exercise where users input room dimensions and select flooring materials.

üéØ LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

- By completing this project, students will:

- Learn basic Python syntax.

- Understand variables, data types, and functions.

- Use conditional statements and loops.

- Work with lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

- Learn basic file handling (reading/writing files).


STEP BY STEP PROCESS:

The project is written as a single Python script that guides users step by step.

STEP 1. Users enter number of rooms.
STEP 2. Users enter room dimensions (length & width).
STEP 3. Choose a flooring material from a list of predefined options.
STEP 4. Calculate total flooring cost based on material price and area.
STEP 5. Optionally save project details to a file.


FEATURES :

‚úÖ Calculate Room/Rooms Area ‚Äì Input room dimensions to get the total square footage.

‚úÖ Select Flooring Material ‚Äì Choose from wood, concrete, brick, or tiles, each with a different cost.

‚úÖ Compute Total Cost ‚Äì The program multiplies area by material cost.

‚úÖ Save Project Details ‚Äì Option to save calculations for future reference.


INSTRUCTIONS :

- Run the Python script.

- Follow on-screen instructions to enter room dimensions and choose a material.

- Get the total flooring cost instantly.

- Decide if you want to save the project details.
