Building Material Cost Estimator

INTRODUCTION :

This project helps IAAC students learn Python and OpenCV through hands-on exercises. It is designed for MRAC students entering their second term, where they focus on sensing.
This tool is a beginner-friendly way to learn Python by working on a simple, real-world problem: estimating flooring costs based on room size and material choice.

DESCRIPTION:

This project is designed for students with an architectural background who are new to Python.
Therefore it assumes that every student is an absolute beginner and is used to teach the fundamental concepts of Python through a hands on approach.
In addition the project teaches Python fundamentals through an interactive exercise where users input room dimensions and select flooring materials.

STEP BY STEP PROCESS:

The project is written as a single Python script that guides users step by step.

STEP 1. Users enter number of rooms.
STEP 2. Users enter room dimensions (length & width).
STEP 3. Choose a flooring material from a list of predefined options.
STEP 4. Calculate total flooring cost based on material price and area.
STEP 5. Optionally save project details to a file.

FEATURES :

✅ Calculate Room/Rooms Area – Input room dimensions to get the total square footage.

✅ Select Flooring Material – Choose from wood, concrete, brick, or tiles, each with a different cost.

✅ Compute Total Cost – The program multiplies area by material cost.

✅ Save Project Details – Option to save calculations for future reference.


LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

By completing this project, students will:

Learn basic Python syntax.

Understand variables, data types, and functions.

Use conditional statements and loops.

Work with lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

Learn basic file handling (reading/writing files).

INSTRUCTIONS :

- Run the Python script.

- Follow on-screen instructions to enter room dimensions and choose a material.

- Get the total flooring cost instantly.

- Decide if you want to save the project details.
